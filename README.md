# Image Processing Toolkit in C++

This C++ program provides a versatile Image Processing Toolkit for handling PGM (Portable Gray Map) images. The toolkit includes functionalities such as loading and saving images, creating negative images, applying filters, rotating, flipping, resizing, cropping, and more.

## Features

1. **Load Image (1):**
   - Load PGM images from files.

2. **Save Image (2):**
   - Save the processed image to a file.

3. **Create Negative Image (3):**
   - Invert colors to create a negative image.

4. **Mean Filter (4):**
   - Apply a mean filter to the image.

5. **Median Filter (5):**
   - Apply a median filter with a specified filter size.

6. **Flip Horizontal (6):**
   - Mirror the image horizontally.

7. **Flip Vertical (7):**
   - Mirror the image vertically.

8. **Rotate Clockwise by 90 Degrees (8):**
   - Rotate the image clockwise.

9. **Rotate Counter Clockwise by 90 Degrees (9):**
   - Rotate the image counter-clockwise.

10. **Rotate By Arbitrary Angle (10):**
    - Rotate the image by a user-defined angle.

11. **Resize Image (11):**
    - Change the dimensions of the image.

12. **Apply General Linear Transformation (12):**
    - (To be implemented)

13. **Crop Image (13):**
    - Crop the image based on specified parameters.

14. **Exit (14):**
    - Exit the program.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Load your desired PGM
3. Use the functional menu system and choose your desired options:

## Future Improvements
For future versions, we plan to implement the following enhancements:

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Support for additional image formats such as JPEG and PNG.
- Real-time image processing capabilities.
- Advanced filtering options with custom kernel sizes and types.
- Histogram equalization for enhanced image contrast.
- Feel free to contribute and suggest additional improvements.
